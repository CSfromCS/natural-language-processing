Once upon a time, there was a boy named Mike
He was raised in the hood, life was never quite
Growing up, he faced many struggles and strife
But through it all, he had one love in his life

Rap music was his escape from reality
The beats and lyrics helped him to see
A world beyond his troubled neighborhood
He knew that with hard work, he could change his mood

He started writing rhymes and practicing his flow
In the mirror, he would rap and watch himself grow
He knew that if he could just make it to the top
He could change his life, and make a better stop

One day, he had the chance to perform on stage
In front of a crowd, he killed it, he killed it with rage
He had finally made it, he had achieved his dream
And now he is a successful rapper, or so it seems

He never forgot where he came from, and he never will
He always remember the struggles that he had to fulfill
He is now a role model to kids in the hood
Showing them that with hard work, they too could

Rise above their circumstances and chase their dreams
And make a better life, or so it seems

The end
